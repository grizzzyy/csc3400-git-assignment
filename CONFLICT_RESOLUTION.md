CONFLICT RESOLUTION 

README.md Conflict 
-changed the README title in my origal repo and pushed it
and changed the same title and tried to push it and failed, so i ran git pull origin main
git showed the merge conflict and i edited it and kept both files 

CALCULATOR conflict 
-edited the divide by zero error message in the og repo and pushed, edited the same line differently in the cloned repo. Push failed so i pulled the latest changes and got the merge conflict. openened calculator.py and removed the conflic and chose the final message
